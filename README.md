## Showcase
This is the code that backs my personal website. Incase you want to see how poorly it's coded.
It's not production code, and if you weren't sent here, you probably don't need it.

# Heroku Deployment
This is the cicd deployment pipeline for the heroku dyno. It is prepared for running under node/express, so if you want to run it with ng in dev mode you'll have to edit the package.json and change start to startNode and change startNG to start (alternating the configs for ng or node/express). If you don't know what that means, then you probably shouldn't do it.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
